		This week, the mechanical assembly milestone is due. Last week, the Prototype lab had been full so I wasn't able to solder my PCB together.
		Hopefully this week, there are less students using the lab so I can solder. The heart rate sensor
		still hasn't come yet so I'm still waiting for that. I plan to start working to getting my 
		Raspberry Pi up and running by the end of the week.

		This week I plan to solder my PCB board if the Prototype lab isn't full. The first milestone 
		is due where we have to show what we have bought for the project so far. The only thing that
		hasn't come yet is the heart rate sensor. So far I've spent ~$174 on the Raspberry Pi Kit, 
		MQ-3 alcohol gas sensor and the heart rate sensor.
