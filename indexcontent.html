	<p>For the open house on Saturday, I managed to get the raspberry pi to connect with a static IP with remote desktop connection 
	and get both of my sensors to output data to the terminal. The alcohol sensor needs some calibration as it shows the value changing  
	when exposed to alcohol vapor, but they are not the correct values. The heart rate sensor shows a low value in the first couple of 
	seconds, but then jumps up to the correct reading and sometimes spikes up and down. For the finished hardware, plan to get the 
	average of values in 10 seconds and then display it. At the open house, I received some good feedback regarding my project and I plan 
	to include some of them into my project. Before the end of the semester, I plan to design and make a case for my project.</p>

	<p>As of this week, I have a working raspberry pi that I can remotely connect to via a hotspot from my phone.
	I still plan on setting up a static IP for my raspberry pi because a hotspot is not reliable all the time as you could
	lose signal at any time. I'm on track to having the raspberry pi read and display the readings from the sensor
	to the terminal for the Saturday Open House. I have recieved everything that I have ordered for this project. The Raspberry Pi 3,
	MQ-3 Alcohol Gas Sensor, and the heartrate sensor. The only problem I have is trying to get the sensor data to display correctly
	to the terminal.</p>

		This week, the mechanical assembly milestone is due. Last week, the Prototype lab had been full so I wasn't able to solder my PCB together.
		Hopefully this week, there are less students using the lab so I can solder. The heart rate sensor
		still hasn't come yet so I'm still waiting for that. I plan to start working to getting my 
		Raspberry Pi up and running by the end of the week.

		This week I plan to solder my PCB board if the Prototype lab isn't full. The first milestone 
		is due where we have to show what we have bought for the project so far. The only thing that
		hasn't come yet is the heart rate sensor. So far I've spent ~$174 on the Raspberry Pi Kit, 
		MQ-3 alcohol gas sensor and the heart rate sensor.

		This week our Proposal is due and groups were made. I'm in a group with Eugene and Adriene 
		and we are planning to do a portable breathalyzer.
